## Method 1: Using the Web App (Recommended)

1. Download the correct firmware file (.bin) from our [firmware repository](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QqQZ37dr1o1E2UW8FfLWYng1Vx1vGtFh):
   - Choose either "Upcycled" or "Original" version
   - Can be downloaded on phone or laptop

2. Update through Web App:
   - Open the web app (find IP address in touch menu if needed)
   - If showing 'Disconnected', restart and reconnect to WiFi
   - Go to Settings
   - Click "Firmware Update" then "Go to Updater"
   - Ensure OTA Mode is set to 'Firmware'
   - Upload the .bin file

**Note:** If you see a blank or glitchy screen after update, you may have uploaded the wrong firmware version. Simply repeat the process with the other firmware version.

## Method 2: Using Web Installer

For cases where the Web App method isn't working, you can use the [Livegrid Web Installer](https://livegrid.github.io/Livegrid-Web-Installer/).

1. Connect your Livegrid device to your computer via USB
2. Access the Web Installer interface
3. Upload the correct firmware

**Important:** This method will perform a factory reset on your device, removing all custom settings.

If you encounter any issues during the update process, try restarting your device and attempting the update again.
