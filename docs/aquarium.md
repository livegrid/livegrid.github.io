# Aquarium

Your Livegrid is home to a diverse aquatic ecosystem. You start with 5 fish, but as those fish grow, they will lay eggs. Within a few weeks, you will have a thriving ecosystem with a diverse aquatic life.

If you can't find them, just use the touch buttons to drop some food in, and they will come rushing into the canvas to eat. However, they can find their own food so don't feel the need to feed them all the time.

Each fish is different from the rest, and no 2 Livegrids are the same.

The aquarium state is autosaved every 30 minutes. So if you lose power or unplug your Livegrid, it will remember come back to life where you left off.
