# Hardware

The inbuilt support for web-app is intended for advanced users as it can lead to glitches and minor issues. However, it is fairly simple and fun to use and if you are interested, please don't hesitate and try it out. Follow the steps below to get into it-

### Connect to WiFi

1. `Connect to Livegrid` - When plugged in, Livegrid creates a WiFi network of its own (conveniently called Livegrid). This will expire in a few minutes - so if you don't see it, simply restart your Livegrid. 
2. `Access the Captive Portal` - Connecting to Livegrid will redirect you to the captive portal.
3. `Enter your WiFi Credentials` - Find your WiFi network name (SSID) and enter your password.
4. `Submit and Connect` - Click on `Submit` and you are in.
5. `Check the IP address` - Click on `Back` to see the IP address assigned to your Livegrid.
6. `Connect to the Web App` - Open a browser and type in that IP address.
7. `Enjoy` - You can now enjoy your Livegrid.

### Create a shortcut on your phone

1. `Open the Web App` - Open the web app on your browser.
2. `Open the browser menu` - Click on the menu button on the top left or top right corner.
3. `Click on the Add to Home Screen Button` - Click on the `+ Add to Home Screen` button.
4. `Save` - Click on `Save` and you can now find your Livegrid on your home screen.
