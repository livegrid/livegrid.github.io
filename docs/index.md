# Welcome to Livegrid

Weather you have just plugged in your first Livegrid device, or are looking to understand more about how it all comes together - this is the place to be.

## Plug-and-Play

Primarily, Livegrid is a plug-and-play solution. It uses internal sensors to collect data on temperature, humidity and CO2 levels of the space it's in. 
But instead of displaying that data in form of numbers of complicated graphs, it shows it in form of a beautiful aquatic ecosystem.

## Touch Control

The 2 touch buttons give you a basic control over your Livegrid. Here's the list of actions you can perform-

* `Go Back` - Leave the menu.
* `Power Off` - Turns the display off (not the ecosystem). Use touch buttons to wake up again.
