It uses internal sensors to collect data on temperature, humidity and CO2 levels of the space it's in. </p> <p>But instead of displaying that data in form of numbers of complicated graphs, it shows it in form of a beautiful aquatic ecosystem.</p> <p>The best way to understand is to see the demo on the first boot. This can be restarted using touch buttons as shown below. You can find more details in the Aquarium section.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#touch-control","title":"Touch Control","text":"<p>The 2 touch buttons give you a basic control over your Livegrid, which might be enough for you.
